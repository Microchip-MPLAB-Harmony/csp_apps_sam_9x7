# FLEXCOM TWI (I2C) EEPROM

This example application shows how to use the flexcom module in TWI mode.

## Description

This application configures the flexcom peripheral in TWI mode to read and write data from an external EEPROM memory chip. Data is written to the EEPROM and then read back and compared. Successful comparison is indicated by turning on an LED.

## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_sam_9x7) and then click Clone button to clone this repository or download as zip file.
This content can also be downloaded using content manager by following these [instructions](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager/wiki).

Path of the application within the repository is **apps/flexcom/flexcom_twi_eeprom/firmware** .

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.

| Project Name      | Description                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| sam_9x75_eb.X | MPLABX project for [SAM9X75-EB Evaluation Board]() |
|||

## Setting up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](../../docs/readme_bootstrap.md) for details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

| Project Name| Board|
|:---------|:---------:|
| sam_9x75_eb.X | [SAM9X75-EB Evaluation Board]() |
|||

### Setting up [SAM9X75-EB Evaluation Board]()

#### Addtional hardware required

- SD Card with FAT32 file system

#### Setting up the SD Card

- Download harmony MPU bootstrap loader from this [location](firmware/at91bootstrap_sam_9x75_eb.X/build/binaries/boot.bin)
- Copy the downloaded boot loader binary( boot.bin) onto the SD card

#### Setting up the board

- SDMMC slot used for bootloading the application is SDMMC0 (J8)
- Connect the DBGU0 J34 on board to the computer using a UART-FTDI cable (to enable debug com port)
- Connect the USB port J28 on board to the computer using a micro USB cable (to power the board)
- *NOTE - No external hardware is required as on-board EEPROM 24AA02E48T used in demo*

## Running the Application

1. Build the application using its IDE
2. Copy the output binary (named 'harmony.bin') onto the SD Card (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section above for setting up the SD card)
3. Insert the SD card into SDMMC slot on the board (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section for the correct SDMMC slot)
4. Reset the board to run the application
5. LED indicates the success or failure:
    - LED is turned ON when the value read from the EEPROM matched with the written value
    - LED is turned OFF when the value read from the EEPROM did not match with the written value

Following table provides the LED name:

| Board      | LED Name                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| [SAM9X75-EB Evaluation Board]() | RGB_LED(Green)  |
